 * Monitor the active user limit (or any limit you desire),

 * Bridge blocking is represented by an `isBlocked` attribute,
 * and it's up to the implementation to decide what to do with that information.
 *
 * If a custom blocking/unblocking implementation is needed,
 * override `blockBridge()` and `unblockBridge()` respectively.
 * It's the caller's responsibility to call the base class methods
 * to flip the actual `isBlocked` flag. Any errors thrown in the custom implementations
 * get automatically caught (and logged) by `checkLimits()`
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param limit The upper user limit - the bridge gets blocked when it gets *exceeded* (not reached!)
